## Inheritance

devflow is class-based, so we support inheritance naturally. You can define the layout function in a base class, then define overrideable callbacks in the derived class.

the only problem is reload system. To make everything simple, we won't support new/delete method of all base classes, only leaf class can new/delete special methods or callbacks.
