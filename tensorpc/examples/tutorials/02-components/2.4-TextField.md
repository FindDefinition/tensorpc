## TextField 

A text field is a component that allows the user to enter text. 

The TextField is one of the two UI components that need to use debounce. The other is the Slider. This makes TextField a semi-uncontrolled component.

### Basic Usage

```Python
class App:
    @mark_create_layout
    def my_layout(self):
        return mui.VBox([
            mui.TextField("Text Field Label"),
        ])

```
